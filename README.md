# Top Down RPG template for Love2D

Getting started with a framework that appears so barebone as Love2D can be a pretty daunting task, yet it can be **much more powerful and optimized** than a false 2D tool such as Unity or Godot. You can use this template to get started quickly when making an RPG. This is still in development and will be expanded to add mechanics like quests, interactions, and rooms.

You do not need anything but the **Love2D framework and an IDE to start development**, since all the dependencies are bundled with the template. You can easily change your sprites and maps with the same format as the ones that were used with the template, with the same layers, and collisions will work without any fiddling around. 

Current features:
- Collisions implemented with tilemap
- WASD movement
- Easy map making with **Tiled**

For any help go to the love2D documentation.

Thanks to Challacade for the assets and introducing me to Love2D
